## A High Level Desc of Future Plans

- Stage 0
  A password manager is a crisp idea to quickly validate if we got our ideas right. An efficient and secure way to manage password should be a basic human right. 

  SkyePass - a free, opensource, extensible and decentralized password manager is our first product to the market. It will deliver most common functionalities of common competitors with open APIs for extensibilities, that allows for developer to build lightweight applications without the caring too much of handling user credentials.

- Stage 1
  Some Ideas based on our core philosophy principles:

  - A service to map private credentials to public identity for the blockchain ecosystem. (i.e. Twitter handle to a DOT public address)

  - A developer kit to enable blockchain-based single sign-on

  - A marketplace to trade/rent login credentials

  - Semi-centralized backup, secret keeping services for SkyePass

- Stage 2

  - Enterprise level credential management: seamless and unified audit & compliance, multi-factor authentication, provisioning, password manager and single sign-on

  - Cryptographic based employee ID card solution

  - Hardware enhanced employee identity. (i.e. a Ledger, your phone are then only passwords an employee needs)




## Future Plan on SkyePass
We do plan to build a for-profit business and seek equity investments, but we believe that a good password manager should be a common goods. 

#### For the core password manager

For local usage, that means no syncing between devices, no sharing with others, we think it would be absolutely ridiculous to charge people for that, because it basically does not cost us anything. However, for other use cases, on a public V1.0 launch, there can be cost related to IPFS storages and smart contract calls, but it is gonna be way cheaper than any other commercial products. I think it would be safe to assume a cost of \$2/year for one user with extra-heavy usage. For a team of 10 people, 1Password will charge (\$7.99 X 12 months X 10 users) \$960 per year. SkyePass will change this charging schema.We want to make the pricing as transparent as possible. 

When a user, Alex, created a wallet/account and choose to go for "premium features" (i.e. syncing between devices, sharing with others etc.). We want to ditch the idea of "Alex's account at SkyePass" but to "Alex's account on a generic blockchain". Alex can fund her account either by transferring some funds from Coinbase or other crypto wallets, or we will hook up a credit card to crypto portal (like MoonPay). We are going to give Alex a simple estimation calculator of how much she would need to top-up per year based on how many devices of vaults she plans to create and share. Usually, for a typical user (add in 300 items, password, notes or credit cards, one vault for herself, one vault for the family and one vault for work), we would recommend somewhere about \$5 per year compare to a $40 bill I pay for a commercial alternative. A percentage (somewhere between 20% to 40%)of the inbounding funds will be taken to form a treasury. And, of course, we will show Alex how much she can save compare to commercial options. Alex has complete control over her account. She can send out the funds she holds other wallets when she wants. When she is sharing a vault with others, she can choose to send funds to other's account if she allows them to make changes to the vault.(Just in the same way when a team leader of a team handles all bills for a SaaS product). 

In summary, we are giving the freedom back to our users and let them decide how they want to pay. We will design UX to make managing funds really easy like a commercial alternative. 

#### Integrated Identity Solution

1. We plan to build an auction market for user handle on a Substrate-based public chain. (refer above in `More Potential For a Password Manager`)
2. We plan to build a market for trading digital identities.  
3. We plan to offer the identity solution in a consulting package for business teams.

#### Hardware Wallet Integration

We can also create a special version of SkyePass (or a special login method to use hardware wallet) to support only vault creation from hardware wallet. 

#### Backup/Secret Keeping Nodes

Because we are building a Shamir secret sharing mechanism at our very core encryption schema, we can explore the idea of providing an optional, commercial and centralized backup nodes. 

#### Marketplace

We allow and encourage our community members to build paid extensions on top of our APIs. One idea can be a subscription-based password watchtower service and like all platforms, we will take a percentage of the proceeding to the treasury. 

#### Treasury

Treasury is built for those who contributes to the community: those who translate documentations, those who build extensions and those who contribute to the core code base. SkyeKiwi team will permanently hold 29% voting rights in decisions and 3 veto rights per calendar year, partners before the official launch will also be granted 20% voting rights. And we leave the rest to all other treasury contributors proportionally. These numbers or proposals are not final. We still have a lot to figure out. 



### Resource for Future Development 

We are blockchain and impact investing ethusiathics that have been around since 2015. We have worked with huge funds, early crypto adopters, world class agencies and entreprises, brilliant entrepreneurs and problem solvers in Asia and North America. After the PoC phase, we can fill up a world class advisory and operation team in a few weeks.
