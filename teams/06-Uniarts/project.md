# About Uni-Arts
Uni-Arts is a decentralized exhibition & auction house for crypto artworks and collections, and it is developed on its own substrate based blockchain network. Uni-Arts offer user-friendly NFT creation tool that allow creators to publish their works on the network with almost zero knowledge of blockchain. Also, Uni-Arts’ economic model provide incentive for both creators and collectors to list and trade artworks though the auction house.

* Uni-Arts is a substrate based blockchain network for NFT creation, exhibition, and auction. 
* Uni-Arts offer user-friendly NFT creation tool that allow community creators to publish their works on the network with almost zero knowledge of blockchain.  
* Uni-Arts provide industry grade NFT pubilcation tools that support dynamic effects with random elements powered by blockchain based random number generator. 
* Uni-Arts' support cross-chain assets and aim to become the major gateway between Ethereum & substrate based networks.

## Solution

### Multi-Chain NFT Support
The protocol layer of Uni-Arts is an Application Blockchain (App Chain) which focuses on providing security and other decentralized infrastructure for the exhibition & auction house built above. Uni-Arts chain is developed via substrate, and it can interact with other substrate based bridge chain (i.e.. Darwinia) to support NFTs transferred from established blockchain network (i.e.. Ethereum) to list in the auction house or to transfer away.

### User Friendly NFT Maker
Uni-Arts NFT Maker is a windows application that allow its user to pack and publish their artworks on Uni-Arts chain as a NFT. User may combine visual and audio file (eg. Picture, video, gif …etc.) with one or few preset dynamic effects with random elements which supported by the random number generator of Uni-Arts blockchain network, thus the NFTs created by this tool are truly unique, not only in turns of crypto identification, but also in visual presentation. Uni-Arts aims to lower the barrier of NFT creation and collection, hence the degree of creation freedom is limited for now as a trade off, and its developers plan to add more feature for NFT Maker in the future.

### Incentive for Both Creator and Collector
Create NFT via NFT maker cost U-ink as gas, and can be listed in the Uni-Arts exhibition hall. Every user can upvote for NFTs they like in the exhibition hall with U-ink, and the NFT received most amount of upvotes will become the ‘Daily Auction Star’ for next day. Once selected, the NTF owner can receive 50% of the U-ink spent for upvotes.
Once the NFT was sold though auction, the winner (new owner) can issue tokens NSH-X,(NFT Stakeholder) where X is the name of NFT, to represent the value-added part of the NFT from its next sale. NSH serves as an effective tool of value discovery for NFT in the market. Once the NFT is sold again, NSH-X holder can spend the NSH-X to claim the benefit.
