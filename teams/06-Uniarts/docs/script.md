Hello everyone, let me show you the cloud painting chain project. First of all, let's take a look at the product function - home page:

At the top of the home page is the banner, where daily activities and advertising entrance are displayed. The following shows the function entrance of wallet, application certificate and certificate query. The function entrance shows the auction entrance. Platform users can apply to launch an auction, and all the auction items are displayed in the details page.

Next, the recommended works are displayed below the entrance of the auction. The platform will screen out some excellent works and recommend them to the home page to increase the exposure of excellent works. The works on consignment or auction may be displayed here.

OK, now let's look at the column "market". All the works on the platform are displayed on this page. Users can filter works by category, material, price and other fields, or search directly through the search box. Click to enter the details of the work, you can buy directly.

Next, let's look at the "creators" below. This page mainly recommends excellent creators of the platform, with one person in each issue. The list below shows the creators recommended in previous periods. Click to enter the creator details page to view more information.

Next is my account. Users can manage their works after logging in with a third-party plug-in wallet. First of all, users need to upload their works. After successful upload, they need to wait for official review. OK, let's take a look at the works I uploaded before. We can directly click "sell". The works are sold on the shelves, and other users can buy them directly. We can also launch an auction of the work. Before launching the auction, we need to fill in the auction time, starting price and other parameters. When the auction time is up, the one with the highest price will win.

OK, let's go to the market page and demonstrate how to buy. First, select a work, and then click the "buy" button, that is, the purchase is successful. After the purchase, you can see it in the "not on sale" work in my account. I can edit the price of the work and launch the sale again.

OK, the main functions of cloud painting chain are introduced here. More functions can be entered app.uniarts.me Experience. Thank you!
