# uni-arts-web-frontend

This project is developed based on Vue 2

The framework for interaction between the front end of Uniarts and substrate is [@polkadot/api](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api)

The interaction with the wallet is [@polkadot/extension-dapp](https://github.com/polkadot-js/extension)

[Explorer](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorerhttps://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer) is used to query information on the substrate chain

## Requirements
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version >= 12.16.3 or above (which can be checked by running `node -v`). You can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/) for managing multiple Node versions on a single machine installed

* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) version >= 1.22.5 (which can be checked by running `yarn --version`). Yarn is a performant package manager for JavaScript and replaces the `npm` client. It is not strictly necessary but highly encouraged.
